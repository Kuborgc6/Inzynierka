# Repository my Bachelor of Science Thesis: _Study of the directivity of acoustic signals_

The aim of the work is to analyze the effectiveness of estimating the direction
of arrival of acoustic signals using the MUSIC algorithm. The research is divided into
two parts, simulation and experimental. In the simulation part, it is checked how the
quality of the results is influenced by the change in the distance between the receivers,
the number of microphones, the frequency of the tested signal and the signal-to-noise
ratio. In the experimental part was created a system for recording signals, which consists
of 4 microphones, amplifiers and a sound card. This is operated by software prepared
using theMatlab, a numeric computing environment developed byMathWorks. Later, the
estimation of the direction of arrival was performed using the MUSIC algorithm. It was
checked in the different angle of arrival and frequency of the signal.
